= MobileFrontend Extension =
The MobileFrontend extension adds a mobile view to your mediawiki instance.

== Installation ==
	See http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:MobileFrontend#Installation

== Configuration ==
See http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:MobileFrontend#Configuration_settings

== Development ==

=== CSS ===
Ensure all css passes the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Coding_conventions/CSS|style guidelines]
When adding a javascript module, ensure that the css module has the same name.
e.g. javascripts/banner.js has the corresponding stylesheet stylesheets/banner.css

Introduce any browser specific patches in the relevant stylesheet. If the browser does not have its own stylesheet considering adding one in DeviceDetection.php

=== Javascript ===
Javascript can be found in the javascript folder. Any javascript committed to the core must pass the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Coding_conventions/JavaScript|style guidelines]

=== HTML ===
HTML should validate via http://validator.w3.org/ - note at the current time do not worry about markup introduced via wikitext.

== Images ==
If you are adding images to the extension please ensure they have been [http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/ optimised] beforehand.

=== Committing ===
* Commits are important as they give the reviewer more information to successfully review your code and find errors or potential problems you might not have thought of
* Commits are also useful when troubleshooting issues and refactoring. If it's not clear why a line of code is in the repository important bug fixes could be lost.
* Commits should be as minor as possible. Please avoid removing unrelated console.log statements, fixing unrelated whitespace etc.. do that in a separate commit which mentions the word cleanup.
* First line commit should summarise the commit with bug it fixes if applicable. e.g. Fix problem with toggling see bug x
* Second line should be blank
* Third line should go into detail where necessary providing links to blog posts/other bugs to provide more background. Mention the platforms/browsers the change is for where necessary
** e.g. 'this is a problem on android but not osx see http://<url> which explains problem in detail'
** e.g. 'this is a workaround for a known bug in opera mobile see http://<url>'

=== Testing ===
